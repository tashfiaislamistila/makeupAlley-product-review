        "review": "The color of this lipstick is gorgeous! The absolute perfect poison apple red. It has a bit of a cool tone to it so it's perfect for blondes but it also looks good on warmer complexions. A tiny bit of shimmer but nothing alarming. The only thing is it tends to go on a little dry. But it doesn't dry out your lips, it just lasts. Hard to explain. A very good formula. Doesn't smear or smudge either. I love it And with a monochromatic look like a red eye shadow and a red blush, and maybe a red outfit you'll really be making a statement. Also I like to use it as blush. And it comes in a travel size if you don't know if your ready to commit to the color. MAC always has free ship and check out their recycling program! FREEBIES."

        "review": "Beautiful saturated red that will make your teeth even whiter, no orange no blue, just pure red. The formula is terrible though,you literally have to drag it on your lips. Best technique is to use a brush to roughly apply a first coat, blot and then go straight from the bullet. That way it won't leave a dreaded middle patch in the centre of your lips if you plan to wear it for a meal. It's great, it's a classic and it's been around forever but I feel the new reds by Lisa Eld ridge are far better."
